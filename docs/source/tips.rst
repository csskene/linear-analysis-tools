There could be many options to be set to run this code. Luckily, these can all be written in a file and can be used by running the code with the option `-options_file`. For example, if the code options are in *opts.txt* the code can be used with these arguments by running
```
mpiexec python resl.py -options_file opts.txt
```
For a comprehensive breakdown of the code use the argument `-log_view`.
